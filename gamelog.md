## game 1

evil wins badly

- 10 players (imp, empath, investigator, clockmaker, scarlet woman, sage, seamstress, oracle, poisoner, washerwoman)
- poisoner really good 3/4 nights, bluff saint kept them alive
- town executions not good, left with very small amount of correct info.  pretty much impossible solve for town even if vigormortis wasnt on the script

game was not fast :/ 

d1: poisoner got empath (next to imp) day 1, town executes empath
d2: (poisoner poisons seamstress no-op) imp kills clockmaker, town executes oracle
d3: poisoner poisons seamstress who uses ability, imp kills investigator, town executes seamstress
d4: poisoner poisons sage (basically only reasonable option left), imp kills sage.  town declines to execute
d5: town declines to kill with 4 people left, but 3 evil left

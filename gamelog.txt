## game 1

evil wins badly (poisoner really good 3/4 nights, bluff saint was really strong), 10 players

game was *not* fast

d1: poisoner got empath (next to imp) day 1, town executes empath
d2: (poisoner poisons seamstress no-op) imp kills clockmaker, town executes oracle
d3: poisoner poisons seamstress who uses ability, imp kills investigator, town executes seamstress
d4: poisoner poisons sage (basically only reasonable option left), imp kills sage.  town declines to execute
d5: town declines to kill with 4 people left, but 3 evil left

imp, empath, investigator, clockmaker, scarlet woman, sage, seamstress, oracle, poisoner, washerwoman

pretty much impossible solve for town even if vigormortis wasnt on the script

I wanted to make a better intro script than Trouble Brewing (hubris, I know!)  This is my attempt at that, based almost entirely on theorycraft.  

tools used
- https://script.bloodontheclocktower.com/
- https://botcscriptcheck.github.io/

## principles for writing this script

- fast-paced, more deaths (assassin, gambler, grandmother), less protection from death (soldier, monk)
- no publicly known hard-confirms (e.g. virgin):  too much info centralization, not fun
- good team should have to bluff too, not just solve
- good characters should be bluffable, but not in a way that makes everyone bluff/pollute public discourse all the time (e.g. juggler, gossip)
- no roles too reliant on storyteller (artist, savant)
- avoid roles with complicated rules edge-cases or that are logistically annoying (lunatic, philosopher, pit hag.  unfortunately all fun characters)
- no characters with removed agency without something interesting compensating (yeah, just thinking of butler)
- no alignment-switching/madness
- for beginner scripts, no characters with overwhelming info (spy)
- for now, stick to Trouble Brewing + Sects & Violets + Bad Moon Rising, so that we retain character tokens

## current worries
- assassin maybe a bit weak.  i considered witch, but i like the extra deaths being at night (assassin + gambler can be funny)
- not many "easy" demon bluffs (removed mayor, soldier)
- grandmother is hard to bluff

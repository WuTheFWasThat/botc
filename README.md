I wanted to make a better intro script than Trouble Brewing (hubris, I know!)  This is my attempt at that, based almost entirely on theorycraft.

## principles for scriptwriting

- fast-paced, more deaths, less protection from death
- no publicly known hard-confirms (e.g. virgin):  too much info centralization, not fun
- good team should have to bluff too, not just solve
- good characters should be bluffable
- no roles too reliant on storyteller (artist, savant)
- avoid roles with complicated rules edge-cases or that are logistically annoying (lunatic, philosopher, pit hag.  unfortunately all fun characters)
- no characters with removed agency without something interesting compensating (just thinking of butler)
- no alignment-switching/madness
- no characters that makes everyone bluff/pollute public discourse all the time (e.g. juggler, gossip)
- for beginner scripts, no characters with overwhelming info (spy)
- for now, stick to Trouble Brewing + Sects & Violets + Bad Moon Rising, so that we retain character tokens

# botc

I wanted to make a better intro script than Trouble Brewing (hubris, I know!)  This is my attempt at that, based almost entirely on theorycraft.  

tools used
- https://script.bloodontheclocktower.com/
- https://botcscriptcheck.github.io/

## principles for writing this script

- fast-paced, more deaths (assassin, gambler, grandmother), less protection from death (soldier, monk)
- no publicly known hard-confirms (e.g. virgin):  too much info centralization, not fun
- good team should have to bluff too, not just solve
- good characters should be bluffable, but not in a way that makes everyone bluff/pollute public discourse all the time (e.g. juggler, gossip)
- no roles too reliant on storyteller (artist, savant)
- avoid roles with complicated rules edge-cases or that are logistically annoying (lunatic, philosopher, pit hag.  unfortunately all fun characters)
- no characters with removed agency without something interesting compensating (yeah, just thinking of butler)
- no madness (cerenovus, mutant)
- no alignment-switching (snake charmer, fang gu), or alignment confusion (marionette)
- for beginner scripts, no characters with overwhelming info (spy)
- for now, stick to Trouble Brewing + Sects & Violets + Bad Moon Rising, so that we retain character tokens

## possible tweaks

### possible small tweaks
- could have dreamer, although makes the storyteller really have to think.  but pretty fun role
- could have klutz instead of saint
- could have godfather or assassin
- could maybe add: no dashii, vortox
- if allowing experimental characters, some nice/simple ones :  
   - townsfolk:  also maybe knight, nightwatchman, preacher, shugenja, steward, noble, magician.  acrobat would be lovely if adding other night deaths
   - minions: goblin, fearmonger? organ grinder?
   - outsider: moonchild?  golem?
   - demons: ...

### gambler/grandmother

I would like to have more deaths!  In particular, I would love to do grandmother, and gambler.  However as is, they're too hard to bluff. 

Possible fixes, but none seem great:
- assassin/godfather as minions.  helps a bit, though still a pretty weird bluff
- add monk/soldier so that gambler can plausibly die in a 1-death night (helps only a bit, doesn't fix grandmother)
- add pit hag lol, fixes a lot of problems by making so many things possible... also really changes the feel of the script and again only helps a bit
- add some BMR demons.. basically just take the script in a BMR direction, but with more deaths 
tempting to tweak characters slightly. like change imp so that after the starpass, new imp gets to also kill, and suddenly imp can bluff gambler. i think this is a better fix gameplay-wise than any of the above
